# job-tracker
Job tracking website.

Being a graduate of Computer Science, applying for multiple jobs in hope of gaining initial experience is not an easy task. This website was designed to streamline this process, providing users with a clean job tracking UI, as well as other features including composing emails, checking CVs, and supporting with cover letters.

Initial plan:

Frontend: React + Vite (for speed) + TailwindCSS
Backend: Python + FastAPI (modern, async, simple) or Django REST Framework
Database: SQLite (for local dev), PostgreSQL (for deployment)
AI: OpenAI API (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)
Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Railway or Render (backend)
